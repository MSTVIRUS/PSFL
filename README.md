# Professor's Script Function Library

For use inside of GLua. If you want to use this in your server addons just put either rename it to something unique and init it in your 'init.lua' file or add this to your autorun in your lua folder and all the functions will be usable.

To access the functions just put fs:'function name'.
To learn it just read the damn source file because I currently don't have time to write a wiki
